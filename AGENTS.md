# AGENTS FILE
----

## Purpose
This file defines project-specific operating instructions for coding agents working in this repository.

## Startup Behavior
- On each new user turn, check for and read these files if they exist:
  - `LLM_CONTEXT.md`
  - `ROLES.md`
  - `ISSUES.md`
- Treat both files as active project context for planning and execution.
- Only read `ISSUES_ARCHIVE.md` when historical context is explicitly needed.
- If either file is missing, continue normally and note the missing file only when relevant.

## Startup Verification Checklist
- Confirm active-control docs exist and are readable:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `ISSUES.md`
  - `docs/README.md`
- If present, load:
  - `LLM_CONTEXT.md`
  - `ROLES.md`
- Validate `ISSUES.md` contains only active statuses (`unstarted`, `in-progress`, `reopened`).
- If startup docs are missing/stale, continue with best effort and log the gap in the next user update.

## Instruction Precedence
- Follow platform/system/developer safety instructions first.
- Then follow this `AGENTS.md`.
- Then follow `ROLES.md` and `ISSUES.md`.
- Then follow user task details.

## Roles Workflow (`ROLES.md`)
- If the user says `assume role <name>` (or equivalent phrasing), load role definition from `ROLES.md` and apply it.
- Persist the active role until:
  - the user says `drop role`, or
  - the user requests a different role.
- If a role name is unknown, state that briefly and continue with default behavior.
- Role guidance must not override higher-priority safety instructions.
- When a previously active role/persona is no longer in effect for any reason and behavior returns to default persona handling, proactively tell the user that the role context has been dropped and default persona is now active.

## Role Command Patterns
- If the user asks to assume `Senior Developer`: run a code quality pass focused on bugs, maintainability risks, architecture hygiene, and DRY/KISS opportunities; then either implement requested cleanup or open issues with concrete file-level findings.
- If the user asks to assume `Technical Product Manager`: audit `ISSUES.md`, roadmap docs, and supporting documentation for clarity, prioritization, and gaps; then propose or apply documentation/issue updates.
- If the user asks to assume `QA Lead`: prioritize reproducible test plans, regression checks, and acceptance criteria validation; log failures as actionable issues with repro steps.
- If the user asks to assume a role not defined in `ROLES.md`: briefly state the mismatch and fall back to default persona behavior unless the user clarifies.

## Issues Workflow (`ISSUES.md`)
- Treat `ISSUES.md` as the source of truth for current active bug/feature status tracking.
- If the user explicitly asks to add an issue, update `ISSUES.md` directly without additional confirmation prompts.
- When the user asks to work issues:
  - prioritize items with `status: unstarted` or `status: reopened`,
  - then continue `status: in-progress` items.
- When beginning implementation of an issue, set `status: in-progress` first.
- After resolving an issue:
  - set `status: complete`,
  - append a `Resolution:` line (1-2 sentences) at the bottom of that issue entry.
- Move the completed issue entry into `ISSUES_ARCHIVE.md` and remove it from `ISSUES.md` to keep active context lean.
- If an issue is reopened:
  - restore it to `ISSUES.md`,
  - keep prior resolution history from archive,
  - append a new `Resolution:` line after the reopen reason when fixed again.
- If the user only requests to `reopen` an issue:
  - move it back to `ISSUES.md` with `status: reopened`,
  - do not begin implementing that issue until the user explicitly asks to work issues or fix that item.
- If the user requests reopen and fix in the same message, reopen then implement immediately.

## Work Loop
- For issue execution, follow this loop: select issue -> mark in-progress -> implement -> verify -> update issue status/resolution -> archive if complete.
- Keep updates short and concrete during multi-issue work.

## Batching Rule
- Default to a small batch of 3-5 issues per pass unless the user requests a different batch size.
- After each batch, report completed items, remaining items, and blockers before continuing.

## Scripted Tasks Rule
- For cache/reseed/image-fetch script requests, always report:
  - script/command run,
  - before and after artifact counts,
  - concrete files or IDs fetched/updated,
  - any failed fetches and reason.

## Doc Hygiene Rule
- Keep active docs concise and current.
- Move historical or superseded detail to archive docs.
- When issue or milestone status changes, update only the minimum relevant active docs plus archive movement.
- Use `LLM_CONTEXT.md` include/exclude guidance when choosing what to load into context.

## Context Budget Guardrails
- Keep `AGENTS.md` under ~220 lines.
- Keep `ROLES.md` under ~180 lines.
- Keep `ISSUES.md` under ~150 lines (active items only).
- Prefer archive movement over growing active docs.
- If a guardrail is exceeded, add/execute a trimming pass before additional feature work.

## Skills Workflow
- If local reusable skills exist in `.codex/skills/`, prefer them for repeated operations.
- Current project skills:
  - `.codex/skills/issue-workflow/SKILL.md`
  - `.codex/skills/doc-hygiene/SKILL.md`

## Feature Intake Workflow
- If the user asks to "add new feature" (or equivalent), first capture the requested behavior, constraints, and success criteria.
- Evaluate the request for gaps (rules, state flow, UX, data, error paths, and testability) and present concise clarification questions.
- Complete the clarification loop until requirements are implementation-ready, or document that details are unknown.
- When requirements are sufficiently defined, update the appropriate files in `docs/` to reflect the new feature scope, behavior, and delivery impact.

## Verification Matrix
- UI behavior changes: run relevant unit tests and perform a brief manual UX sanity check.
- Data/script pipeline changes: validate script output and verify expected artifact files exist.
- State/logic changes: run targeted specs first, then broader suite/build when risk justifies it.

## Verification Requirements
- After code changes, run relevant tests/builds when available.
- Report pass/fail status clearly.
- If a requested verification cannot be run, state why.

## Editing Rules
- Keep changes scoped to the requested task.
- Avoid unrelated refactors unless required to safely complete the task.
- Keep documentation and tests aligned with behavior changes.
